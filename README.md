# Udacity Capstone - Cloud DevOps

## Project Overview
In this project we had to build a CI/CD pipeline for a microservices application. I've designed this CI/CD pipeline to work wth Jenkins and it follows this blue/green deployment methodology. This project has **three** braches **Master**, **blue** & **green**.

## Installation
In order to run this CI/CD pipeline you will first need access to **Jenkins**, and have an **AWS** account. You will also need to install the **Blue Ocean** and **AWS pipline** plugins.

Once you have your Jenkins and AWS enviroments setup you will need to first run my #Create cluster pipeline# which can be found [Here].(https://github.com/adamsteff/capstone_create_cluster_pipeline)
